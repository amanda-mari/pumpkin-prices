# Pumpkin Prices

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze data on pumpkin prices in 13 U.S. cities for 2016-2017. After data cleaning, descriptive statistics will be run to answer questions such as the average, low, and high selling points of pumpkins throughout the year and by city. Further, we will try to fit a mixed model to the data to explain the variation in price by predictors such as city, pumpkin size, and date.
